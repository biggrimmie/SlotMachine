## SlotMachine
Lightweight Slot Machine simulator using Java and JavaFX

This was a program i wrote for a school project that ended up being a lot of fun. I used to play a few gacha games and enjoyed simulators of opening crates, and this simulated a very similar experience.

I used Java to write this program as it's one of my more comfortable languages, and used JavaFX for the GUI

# INSTALLING
Install is pretty simple, just download the files into a single folder and run it in your code editor. 

# USE
Using the program is also pretty simple. Simply input the amount of money you'd like to bet and click Spin the Machine!

# FILES
* JanduraFinalProject - Main file that creates and runs the gui, as well as the main logic
* JanduraPlayer - Class file that keeps track of user money bet, won, and total gain/loss.
* JanduraSlotMachine - Class file that runs the slot machine logic, spinning the machine and determining the outcome
* JanduraSpinMachine - Interface that enforces the spinMachine method on JanduraSlotMachine
